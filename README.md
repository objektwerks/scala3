Scala Tribute
-------------
>Scala is great language when used simply.

>When not used simply, Scala fails. 

>To wit, all pure functional Scala libraries have failed to date.

>Yet Scala purists would have you believe otherwise.

>2023+ will see the most significant decline of Scala.

>Scala will become a simple academic exercise, sadly governed by those of a like mind going forward.

>We knew you well, Scala. Fair well, my favorite language of languages.

>For you served me well for thse mamy years!
